      "answer": "B) Conducting an annual risk assessment to identify potential threats.",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Conducting a risk assessment is a classic example of a managerial control. These controls are focused on the management of risk and information security. They involve planning, policies, and procedures to manage the security environment.",
        "incorrect": {

      "explanation": {

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "A compensating control is an alternative measure used when a primary security control is not feasible to implement. In this scenario, since MFA (a primary control) cannot be used, the team is 'compensating' for its absence with other controls (strict password policy and monitoring).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Directive controls are high-level policies and procedures (e.g., an Acceptable Use Policy). While the password policy is a directive, the overall strategy of using it as an alternative makes it a compensating control.",
          "B": "Corrective controls are used to remediate an issue after a security incident has occurred.",
